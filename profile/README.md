  # VisualSynapse

  **Building the visual cortex for code.**

### The Mission

We believe that **AI writes code faster than it can understand it.**

As we move toward agentic workflows, the bottleneck isn't generating text—it's maintaining the mental map. **VisualSynapse** exists to solve this "context blindness." We are building the infrastructure that gives AI and humans the sight they need to navigate, understand, and evolve complex software architectures without getting lost.

### The Flagship

#### 🧠 [VisualSynapse](https://github.com/VisualSynapse/VisualSynapse)
Our core engine. An MCP server that maps, visualizes, and persists the mental model of your codebase.

*   **See** the unseen dependencies.
*   **Trace** logic flow across files.
*   **Query** your architecture like a graph.
